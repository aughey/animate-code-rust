One of my passions is enabling others through mentoring and teaching.  I spend a lot of time
learning myself by watching videos online, and I've recently turned to creating visual media
to transfer knowledge.

One challenge is compacting really difficult content into a video tweet sized package.  Sometimes
it's just not practical to do.  One of my favorite educators is [Jon Gjengset](https://www.youtube.com/@jonhoo)
who is a brilliant Rustacean.  His videos are not short by design because the content is
genuinely difficult to digest.  While some of my instructional content is of this not-short
nature, I'm looking to challenge myself and create new instructional content through byte-sized
sub-minute videos.

A key piece of this puzzle is generating visual content that aids in the knowledge transfer.
Software engineering is very visual, yet my visual representation is not necessarily 2D, nor is
it necessarily relevant to your visual perception of code.  Nevertheless, the animated visual code
deltas generated by KeyNote and the aforementioned animate-code.com is a very good start.

# Desire

My desire here is to mimic/duplicate the effort shown in a 
[youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXk6Eabu7uM) made by "Josh tried coding". 
But to do so in Rust with possibly a set of tutorial videos and public repository.
